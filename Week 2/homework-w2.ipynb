In this task, you will get the *direct solar radiation* with 1 minute time interval from the *Radiation observations*  at [FMI](http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/download-observations#!/). Plot radiation profile of three different days so that one must be in March, other in July and the last in December (regardless of the year). What measuring station was used? Compare the solar radiation in those 3 days and provide *information* about the potential of solar generation in those days.
