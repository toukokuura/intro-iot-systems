The purpose of the electric heater would be to heat the space that it is in, likely to a specific temperature. \n\nComponents can be divided to structural, operating and flow components. For the heater, examples of structural components are the outer shell of the heater, pipes that hold air/liquid, or mounting brackets. Operating components would be a thermostat, transformers, fans, motors etc. Flow components would be electricity, which is used as the resource to generate the heat.
